## ⚡ Introduction

Welcome to **VoltPress** — a bold attempt by an **ambitious junior developer** to rebuild WordPress entirely with **JavaScript**, just for the love of learning, curiosity, and creativity.

This project is not (yet) a competitor to WordPress.
It’s an **educational experiment**, a **playground for builders**, and a **community of learners** who believe that the web can be reimagined — one volt at a time ⚡

If that spirit speaks to you, you’re in the right place.

## 🧠 Philosophy

VoltPress is built on three simple principles:

1. **Learn by Building**
   Every pull request, even small, is a chance to understand how CMSs truly work behind the scenes.

2. **Reimagine, Don’t Copy**
   We take inspiration from WordPress but reimagine how things *could* be done differently — simpler, faster, cleaner.

3. **Build in Public**
   We share progress, struggles, and discoveries openly.
   Every line of code is a learning moment, not a secret.

## 🧡 A Note from Prince

> “I started VoltPress as a crazy idea — to rebuild WordPress with JavaScript because I hate PHP 😅
> But deep down, it’s more than that:
> It’s a way to push my limits, learn from others, and show what a young African dev can build with passion and consistency.”

Welcome to **VoltPress**,
where learning meets creation ⚡
